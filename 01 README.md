# RFM & CLTV Customer Segmentation


## **Background** 

  - XYZ is an Egyptian <u>online retail</u> start-up where the <u>marketing</u> team needs to run marketing more <u>effectively yet efficiently</u>. As a start-up, its performance is acceptable, however, it can perform rather better once the <u>problems</u> they face got solved.


## **Problems** 

1. <u>Fluctuations</u> in the number of orders made by customers.

2. Many customers <u>churned</u> from XYZ. 

3. Marketing campaigns' <u>impact</u> on business performance is not measurable.


## **Objectives** 

1. Launching <u>customized accurately targeted</u> marketing campaigns to maintain <u>high monthly orders</u>.

2. Planning for <u>feasible reactivation and retention</u> marketing campaigns.

3. Measuring <u>marketing activities' impact</u> on the business.


## **Questions** 

1. What are the <u>customer groups</u> based on their ordering behaviors? <u>(i.e *recency, frequency and monetary value*)</u>

2. What are the customers' future <u>worth/value</u> based on their ordering behaviors?


3. What are the <u>crucial KPIs</u> of the business?


## **Analytics Solutions / Methodologies**

1. Using ML Clustering models to conduct <u>RFM Customer Segmentation</u>.

2. Using BG/NBD & Gamma-Gamma Models to <u>predicting Customer lifetime value</u>.

3. Building a <u>business intelligence (BI) dashboard</u> to keep track of XYZ's business performance.

## **Data Cleansning & Preprocessing**

  - Renaming the columns to be in lowercase separated by '_' instead of spaces (i.e following the same naming convention).
  - Modifying columns data types.
  - Checking for duplicates.
  - Checking for nulls.
  - Sorting our dataframe by order_datetime

  # **Modeling**

  - We've built **[[ML Algo]]** to predict **[[target]]** using **[[Inputs]]**.

  | HyperParameters | Values   |
  |-----------------|----------|
  |                 |          |
  |                 |          |

  - Our model's accuracy is **[[## %]]** (i.e For every 100 predictions, there are ## predictions are true.)
